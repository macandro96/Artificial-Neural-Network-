# Artificial-Neural-Network-
This repo contains the implementation of neural network from scratch (using just numpy). The network was trained and tested on 9 classes from EMNIST dataset. We have also performed some experiments to check if there is any improvement in accuracy. 
Please refer to the Report.pdf for the exploration and conclusion of the experiments.

Additionally, we have also added Batch-Norm, Drop-Out, L1 and L2 regularization in the implementation.

To run, download the EMNIST dataset and then run Main.py. Hyperparameters, can be changed in the main.py
